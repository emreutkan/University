T9 - text detector
"T9 is a predictive text technology for mobile phones (specifically those that contain a 3Ã—4 numeric keypad)" - Wikipedia.
Most old phones used this technology to type a message based on clicked numbers. You can check the visual
layout from the internet, but the textual format is given below.
----------------------------------
1           2->"abc"    3->"def"
4->"ghi"    5->"jkl"    6->"mno"
7->"pqrs"   8->"tuv"    9->"wxyz"
----------------------------------

For simplicity, the words displayed to the user will be only limited to the characters in the corresponding numbers.
In other words, if the user clicks 224, it can be interpreted as any combination of the letters from the 2,2 and 4.
Some examples are "aha","aia","bia","aga" etc.
As the numbers increase, more complicated words can be written. For example, 28222747 can be interpreted as "atabaris".

For a given number and the list of words. Write a program with a dynamic programming approach to returning possible words
that exist in the number.
For the input 3662277 and string words[] = {"foo","bar","baz","foobar","emo","cap","car","cat"}
it should return an array (vector,list etc.) with the words {"foo","bar","foobar","emo","cap","car"}

For example "baz" is not included because "229" is not exist in "3662277".

Note: The fundamental rule of dynamic programming is that the repetitive calculations to solve a problem can be
reduced by storing them. To solve this problem, you have to do a partial text/number search in some way.
It will take a considerable amount of time as the list size and the words increase; maybe this can be reduced by using
the help of some data structures and a dynamic programming approach.
